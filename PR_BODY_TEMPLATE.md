# Pull Request - TODO App (develop -> main)

## Summary
Built a full-stack TODO application with CRUD, done toggle and persistence in MongoDB.

## What I built
- Backend with RESTful API (Express + Mongoose)
- Frontend with React that consumes the API
- Basic form validation and loading/error states

## How to run
See README.md files in `todo-backend` and `todo-frontend`.

## Notes
- Use MongoDB local or Atlas; set MONGO_URI in backend `.env`.
- Provide demo video and code walkthrough in the PR body.
